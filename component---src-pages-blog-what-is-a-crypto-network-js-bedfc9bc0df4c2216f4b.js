It can be thought of as a public Excel spreadsheet that updates every few seconds with some strict rules so that nobody can easily cheat. On public blockchains, interactions that change the state of the blockchain are called transactions since they all involve gas as a spam-reducing mechanism (so you must hold some of this "gas" token to interact with the blockchain). All participants in the network have a private key and public key and use the private key to verify proof of ownership of assets and transaction confirmation.'),r.a.createElement("p",null,"The same asset that gas is paid in is also usually used to reward those who create new blocks. Blocks are chained together when a batch of new transactions is made, and the consensus mechanism determines which transactions are included and when. Consensus occurs through a lottery where participants compete to win the block reward. The two most common consensus mechanisms are proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS), and both are a bit complicated so I won't go into them in this post. However, consensus mechanisms have different trade-offs and security considerations."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Currency is a shared belief in the value of something intrinsically valueless.
